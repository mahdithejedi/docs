# `__hash__` in python

**First of all**

## What is hash?

A hash is a function that converts one value to another. Hashing data is a common practice in computer science and is used for several different purposes. Examples include cryptography, compression, checksum generation, and data indexing.

Hashing is a natural fit for cryptography because it masks the original data with another value. A hash function can be used to generate a value that can only be decoded by looking up the value from a hash table. The table may be an array, database, or other data structure. A good cryptographic hash function is non-invertible, meaning it cannot be reverse engineered. <small>[1](https://techterms.com/definition/hash)</small>
