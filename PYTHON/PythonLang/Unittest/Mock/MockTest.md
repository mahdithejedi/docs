# What is mock object?

In object-oriented programming, mock objects are simulated objects that mimic the behavior of real objects in controlled ways, most often as part of a software testing initiative. A programmer typically creates a mock object to test the behavior of some other object, in much the same way that a car designer uses a crash test dummy to simulate the dynamic behavior of a human in vehicle impacts. The technique is also applicable in generic programming.<small>[wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mock_object)</small>
