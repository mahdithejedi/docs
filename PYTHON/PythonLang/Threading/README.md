# What is Thread?

In computer science, a thread of execution is the smallest sequence of programmed instructions that can be managed independently by a scheduler, which is typically a part of the operating system.
 The implementation of threads and processes differs between operating systems, but in most cases **a thread is a component of a process**
<br />

## Thread VS Process

*	rocesses are typically independent, while threads exist as subsets of a process
*	processes carry considerably more state information than threads, whereas multiple threads within a process share process state as well as memory and other resources
*	processes have separate address spaces, whereas threads share their address space
*	processes interact only through system-provided inter-process communication mechanisms
*	context switching between threads in the same process typically occurs faster than context switching between processes
