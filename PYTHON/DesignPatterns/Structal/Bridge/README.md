You think you stuck in a stiuation what you have new feature and for that new feature you have to change your class attributes and methods and the way they work, in this situation what if will happen to clients?? 

__do they have to change all the code they write?__

**__or use call a new instance instead of old one and do nothing?__**

this is what **bridge** want to say...
