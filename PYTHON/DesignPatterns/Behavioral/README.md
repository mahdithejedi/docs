# What is Behavioral Design Pattern?

In software engineering, behavioral design patterns are design patterns that identify common communication patterns among objects. By doing so, these patterns increase flexibility in carrying out communication.

## Behavioral Design Patterns

| Pettern | Description |
|:-------:|:-----------:|
|Chain Of Resposibility|This pattern will let  you pass requests along a chain of handlers|
| Meditator | an object that encapsulates how a set of objects interact(an object act like proxy between objects |
| Command | An object will encapsulate and act like proxy, disallowed any direct connection between two object(in server/Client which the client not directly call the APIs, a method or obj do encapsulation and send data to server) |
| Iterator | traverse a container and access the container's elements(Iteration behavoir should be inside obj)|
| Observer | provide a callback for notification of events/changes to data |
| State    | Objects can alter their behavior when internal state of obj changes |
| Strategy | the strategy pattern is a behavioral software design pattern that enables selecting an algorithm at runtime. Instead of implementing a single algorithm directly, code receives run-time instructions as to which in a family of algorithms to use|
