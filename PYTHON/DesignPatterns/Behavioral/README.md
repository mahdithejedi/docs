## Behavioral Design Patterns

| Pettern | Description |
|:-------:|:-----------:|
|Chain Of Resposibility|This pattern will let  you pass requests along a chain of handlers|
| Meditator | an object that encapsulates how a set of objects interact(an object act like proxy between objects |
| Command | An object will encapsulate and act like proxy, disallowed any direct connection between two object(in server/Client which the client not directly call the APIs, a method or obj do encapsulation and send data to server) |
| Iterator | traverse a container and access the container's elements(Iteration behavoir should be inside obj)|
| Observer | provide a callback for notification of events/changes to data |
| State    | Objects can alter their behavior when internal state of obj changes |
