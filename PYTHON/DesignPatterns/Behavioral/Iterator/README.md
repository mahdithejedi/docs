# What is Iterator?

Iterator is a behavioral design pattern that lets you traverse
elements of a collection without exposing its underlying
representation (list, stack, tree, etc.). [1][First]


## Where to use it?

*	*Use the Iterator pattern when your collection has a complex
data structure under the hood, but you want to hide its com-
plexity from clients (either for convenience or security
reasons).[1][First]

*	*Use the pattern to reduce duplication of the traversal code
across your app.[1][First]

*	*Use the Iterator when you want your code to be able to tra-
verse different data structures or when types of these struc-
tures are unknown beforehand.[1][First]
