#  What is builder and where we use it?

Builder is work when we have the objects with same family so instead of make couple same object 
**We decouplicate it**

we make a base class do the same stuff there and extend it in the base classes

what acctually happend here is in Builder design pattern focues is on create complex object step by step  <small>[source](https://stackoverflow.com/a/757773/9651641)</small>

[Itâ€™s especially useful when you need to create an object with lots of possible configuration options.](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/builder/python/example)
