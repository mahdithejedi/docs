## 1. Names should be Intention-Revealing!
Names should be increase intention in the code.. beacuse variables doesn't just hold a value, it should show it's value in it's name. 
It should answer questions such as What it it? Why is it here? or What does it do? how it's used and etc...
<br />
Look at the code blow and try to inderstand what is it..
```
```

**Variable should reveal all information about them self in their name. They do not created for nothing just hold a simple value**
