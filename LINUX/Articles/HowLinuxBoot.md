the Linux kernel image is a compressed file that is extracted after it is loaded into memory. During the boot process, the boot loader typically creates a temporary RAM file system, known as initramfs . This file system contains necessary drivers and kernel modules that must be installed to support the real root file system (which is not in main memory).
